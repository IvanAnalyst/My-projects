# My portfolio projects
## ML stock price prediction project
In this project I have created a flexible predictive neural network model with LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) layers using python. I then tested this model on stocks from the NASDAQ exchange. The stock data is gathered using the [Yahoo!Finance's API](https://github.com/ranaroussi/yfinance).

## Financial Statements KPI Analysis project
In this project I have created a dynamic dashboard of the S&P500 companies' annual Balance Sheets and Income statements for the years 2017-2022 using python and Power BI.
